Is single level possible?

## install, i

install a program by url
- shell scripts
- bare binaries
- compressed binaries

re-install broken or partial install?

## update, up (u?)

update a single program by url, or name
or update everything with bare, or -A?

## delete, d

delete (unintall, remove, erase) a single program by url or name

## run, r
would exec, e be better to free up r?

run a script in the sandbox (eg old codecov updater ;) )

## TODO

list installed
list available

info on installed, available
audit on installed, single or both. (fix would be with `up`)

pin/unpin to prevent update? probably not

submit new manifests via PR, submit new checksums etc.
submit scripts that fail to work

HIDE completion command?

version command, or combined doctor/setup
