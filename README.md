üöß ___Disclaimer___: _`welk` is alpha quality software. The API may change
without warning between revisions._ üöß

`welk` is the package manager for software installed with [`curl`][curl] and
[`sh`][sh]. `welk` gives you:
- A sandboxed environment for script execution during install
- Tracking of installed software. No more `$HOME` littered with random
  [Kubernetes][k8s] tools!
- Deletion of installed software.
- Automatic `$PATH` management. Your [`.zshrc`][zsh] has never looked better!

When documentation tells you to run `curl <some url> | /bin/sh`, use `welk`.

## Getting `welk`

Use `curl | sh`, of course! Run:
```sh
curl <TODO ADD FLAGS> <TODO URL> | sh
```

After `welk` is installed it will manage itself.

Make sure `.local/bin` is in your path, as defined by [XDG].

## Quick start

- Install new software with `welk install $URL`
- List installed software with `welk list`
- See the files installed by a script with `welk info $URL`
- Remove everything a script installed with `welk delete $URL`

## Seasons

Open Source is free to play. Like all good free to play experiences, `welk`
releases content and feature drops in seasons. Content from past seasons
remains available to new users; we won't put it in a vault!

The current season is the [*Season of discovery*](./milestone/2).

The next season is the [*Season of the herald*](./milestone/3).

Find more upcoming and past seasons under [milestones][milestones]
